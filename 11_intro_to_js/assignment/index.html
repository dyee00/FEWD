  <!-- Purchase Assignment

	Write a program that does the following

	- Asks the user the price of the product they're buying
	
	- Asks the user how many items of the product are in inventory

	- Asks the user how much money they have

	- Asks the user how many items they wish to buy

	- If the user has enough money and the product is in stock (there are more than zero items), print "Purchase complete"

	- If the user doesn't have enough money, but there are enough items, print "Not enough money"

	- If the user has enough money but there aren't enough items, print "Not enough inventory"

	Bonuses

	Air Conditioner

	In a new file: ac.js

	Using booleans, and conditional statements create an air conditioner program. To start it should prompt the user for the current temperature, then prompt the user a second time for the temperature they would like it to be. If the desired temperature is more than the current temperature, print the following statement to the console: Turning off the A/C! It's too cold!, if the desired temperature is less than the current temperature, print the following statement to the console: Turning on the A/C! It's boiling in here!, else if the temperatures are the same, print the following statement to the console: A perfect temperature. Keep the cool!.

	Temperature Converter

	In a new file: tempConverter.js

	Prompt the user for two inputs: a temperature, and a temperature scale they would like to convert that temperature to.

	The options for temperature scales should be: F to C or C to F

	If a user selects C to F then the temperature the user first input should be assumed to be in Celsius, and should therfore be converted to the Fahrenheit temperature.

	If a user selects F to C then the temperature the user first input should be assumed to be in Fahrenheit, and should therefore be converted to the Celsius temperature.

	Use console.log to print the results of each calculation to the console.

	Calculator

	In a new file: calculator.js

	Prompt the user for 3 input values: 2 numbers, and a math operation.

	Define a conditional statement that will perform the following calculator operations:

	addition
	subtraction
	multiplication
	division
	exponents
	Can you make sure that 0-division does not occur?
