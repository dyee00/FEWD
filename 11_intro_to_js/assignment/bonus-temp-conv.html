	Temperature Converter

	In a new file: tempConverter.js

	Prompt the user for two inputs: a temperature, and a temperature scale they would like to convert that temperature to.

	The options for temperature scales should be: F to C or C to F

	If a user selects C to F then the temperature the user first input should be assumed to be in Celsius, and should therfore be converted to the Fahrenheit temperature.

	If a user selects F to C then the temperature the user first input should be assumed to be in Fahrenheit, and should therefore be converted to the Celsius temperature.

	Use console.log to print the results of each calculation to the console.
